# Unity .gitignore — tuned template
###############################
# Inspired by GitHub Unity template + localized adjustments

# --- Unity generated folders ---
ProiectCTIJ/Library/
ProiectCTIJ/Temp/
ProiectCTIJ/Obj/
ProiectCTIJ/Build/
ProiectCTIJ/Builds/
ProiectCTIJ/Logs/

# User-specific settings
ProiectCTIJ/UserSettings/

# --- Visual Studio / Rider / IDE ---
.vs/
.vscode/
.idea/
*.suo
*.user
*.userprefs
*.csproj
*.sln
*.unityproj
*.pidb
*.booproj

# Mono / .NET
*.dll
*.exe
*.pdb
*.mdb
*.opendb
*.VC.db

# --- Build outputs / packages ---
*.apk
*.aab
*.xcodeproj
*.xcworkspace
*.app
*.ipa
*.unitypackage

# --- Temporary / backup ---
*.tmp
*.temp
*.bak
*.old
*.orig
*.swp

# --- OS generated files ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
desktop.ini

# --- Asset pipeline / caches ---
sysinfo.txt
memorycaptured.*

# --- Prevent accidental checkin of large or binary assets — use Git LFS instead ---
# Add a .gitattributes file to map large binary types to LFS (e.g., *.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text)
# Example: create .gitattributes with:
# *.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
# *.wav filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# --- Optional: ignore JetBrains Rider caches ---
/.idea/
/.idea/*

# --- Scenes auto-save snapshots ---
*.unity~*

# --- Keep ProjectSettings in source control (recommended) ---
# ProjectSettings/ should usually be committed so team members share project-wide settings.
# If you want to ignore user/editor-specific files, add them explicitly here (not the whole folder).
# Example to ignore EditorUserSettings (per-user):
ProjectSettings/EditorUserSettings.asset

# --- Keep Assets and Packages tracked ---
# Important: Do NOT ignore Assets/ or Packages/ or ProjectSettings/ (except user files above).

# End of .gitignore
